        The start is crucial. Before we reflect, we must arrive.
        The Ikigami meditation is a tailor-made invitation to slow down,
        to silence the noise, and to gently open the gate to your inner clarity.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Meditation is not about emptying the mind ‚Äì it‚Äôs about
        shifting attention. In psychology, this shift from
        sympathetic (fight-or-flight) to parasympathetic (rest-and-digest)
        activity enables deeper access to intuition, emotional regulation, and
        insight-based thinking.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I recorded this meditation with my own voice ‚Äì deliberately.
        Because presence cannot be outsourced. It needs resonance, rhythm, and realness.
        What you hear is not a polished studio script ‚Äì it‚Äôs me, holding space for you.
        Gently. Quietly. Bravely.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Take this short break before each reflection.
        It‚Äôs not a habit. It‚Äôs a signal: to return.

      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        The Ikigami Meditation is exclusively available inside the app.
        It is directly integrated into your reflection flow ‚Äì as the very first step
        before the four questions appear.
        No external audio. No distractions. Just you, your breath, and a quiet space to begin.

        ‚Üí You‚Äôll hear it only when you need it ‚Äì not before.
