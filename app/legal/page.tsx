      <p className="mb-4"><strong>European online dispute resolution platform</strong><br />
        Information on online dispute resolution: The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (OS). This platform is intended to serve as a contact point for the out-of-court settlement of disputes relating to contractual obligations of online sales contracts and online service contracts. The platform can be accessed at <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" target="_blank" className="underline">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>.<br />
        We do not take part in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board.

As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 TMG. However, according to Sections 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not apparent at the time of linking. However, permanent control of the content of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation.
