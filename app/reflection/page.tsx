        This is where everything comes together.
        After your four reflections — one for each Ikigai dimension — your inputs are processed silently in the background.

        Unlike traditional journaling, this is not about writing more or phrasing better.
        The goal is not volume. It’s clarity.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Using a psychologically grounded model based on positive psychology,
        your responses are gently filtered, condensed, and interconnected.
        The system looks for overlaps, contradictions, and emerging insights —
        across dimensions and over time.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        What would be hard to see with pen and paper — scattered notes, buried patterns, quiet recurrences —
        becomes visible here. Intelligently. Respectfully. In rhythm with your own voice.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Reflection, in this sense, is not about looking back. It’s about listening in.
        You give presence — and receive perspective.
      </p>

        This is not an answer generator. It doesn’t give advice, summaries, or goals.
        Instead, it reads like a quiet companion — one that listens for truth,
        and mirrors back what you already know, but haven’t yet seen clearly.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The intelligence here is not artificial. It’s relational.
        Between your voice, your timing, your patterns — and your own growth.
